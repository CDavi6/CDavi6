Hey there! I'm Clayton and I have a genuine passion for computers. Coding, gaming and exploring the world of sports are some of my favourite hobbies. My journey in software engineering has been both fun and fulfilling as I have been able to learn so much and create so many awesome things!

With over five years of coding experience, I've become proficient in several languages including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and C#. Additionally, I have a working knowledge of C++ and Python which adds variety to my skill set.

The process of transforming ideas into interactive creations through coding is not only exciting, but also highly rewarding. Continuously seeking new challenges, I strive to push the boundaries of what I can achieve as a software engineer.

Looking forward, I'm excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead. My goal is to contribute to the ever-evolving tech industry by applying my knowledge, creativity and passion to develop innovative designs.

If you're interested in connecting, collaborating, or simply discussing all things tech-related, I'd love to chat! Let's start this journey together and make a positive impact on the digital world, one line of code at a time.
